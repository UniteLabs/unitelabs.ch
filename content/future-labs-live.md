# The SiLA Experience

The SiLA Consortium is a non-profit organisation that gathers life science and software experts from industry and academia to standardise laboratory hard- and software interfaces. SiLA and its members provide a framework for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic laboratory information. The standard defines how information is transported from one system to another. SiLA has a growing global user base and is recognised as the most commonly used laboratory interface standard in the world.

The SiLA Experience is a joint effort of hard- and software vendors that support the standard to showcase the benefits for users with a tangible example: An automation workflow stretching from physical process automation to data transformation and visualisation across vendor barriers. The following companies are taking part in the joint booth at Future Labs Live 2023.
