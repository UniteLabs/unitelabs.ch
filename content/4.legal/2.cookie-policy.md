This Cookie Policy explains how UniteLabs AG ("**company**", "**we**", "**us**", and "**our**") uses cookies and similar
technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at https://unitelabs.ch ("**Site**"). It
explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

In some cases, we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal information if we combine it
with other information.

# What are cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are
widely used by website owners to make their websites work or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting
information.

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, UniteLabs AG) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set by parties
other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable third party features or
functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. advertising, interactive content and analytics). The
parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and
also when it visits certain other websites.

# Why do we use cookies?

We use first and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons for our Site
to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track
and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our online properties. Third parties serve cookies
through our Site for advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.

# How can I control cookies?

You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your
preferences in the <a href="#" onClick="(function() { var _hsp = window._hsp = window._hsp || []; _hsp.push(['showBanner']); })()">Cookie Consent Manager</a>. It allows you to select which categories of
cookies you accept or reject. Strictly necessary cookies cannot be rejected as they are essential to provide you with
services.

If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Site though your access to some functionality and areas of our
Site may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. As the means
by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your
browser's help menu for more information.

Besides, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt-out of targeted advertising. If you would like to find out
more information, please visit [http://www.aboutads.info/<wbr>choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or
[http://www.youronline<wbr>choices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com).

The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Site and the purposes they perform are described
in the tables below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific online properties
you visit):

## Strictly necessary cookies:

Strictly necessary cookies are required to operate or deliver the service you requested from us and, therefore, do not
require you to consent. These cookies are essential to handle access to secure areas or to enable basic services. The
Site cannot function properly without these cookies.

# What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?

Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from
time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that
contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Site or opened an e-mail including
them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a Site to another, to
deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the Site from an online advertisement
displayed on a third-party website, to improve Site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing
campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies
will impair their functioning.

# Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?

The Site may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things,
collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and other site operations.

If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block
Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash
Cookies by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions
that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how
to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later)
how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).

Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the
functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our
services or online content.

# Do you serve targeted advertising?

Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Site. These
companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites to provide relevant advertisements about goods
and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of
advertisements. This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits
to this and other websites to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The
information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other
details that directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.

# How often will you update this Cookie Policy?

We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other
operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please, therefore, re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed
about our use of cookies and related technologies.

The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.
