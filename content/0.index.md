### Integration Layer

Bringing standardised connectivity to any type of instrument, robot, or software
::::

::::content
### Full Control

Go beyond data extraction with access to the full device functionality in real-time
::::

::::content
### All Access

All systems connected to the Integration Layer become a resource in our uniform API
::::

::::content
### Digital Ecosystem

Access our API from within other software, such as ELN, LES, and LIMS
::::

::::content
### Your Path

Build your own logic using our libraries without worrying about infrastructure
::::

::::content
### Limitless Connectivity

Our edge technology makes networking issues a thing of the past

## The agile laboratory

Every lab is different and processes change. In the end, this leaves many manual steps, incomplete data, and missed potential.

- *What if* &nbsp;adapting the tools to the new process was something you could do yourself and in minutes?

- *What if* &nbsp;you could gather instrument data, build visualisations and automate physical processes with a single source of truth?

- *What if* &nbsp;you could prototype a new automation, tweak it, and finally scale it up into a long-running application on the same platform?

- *What if* &nbsp;you could get all your device data digitised, automated, and stored securely?

- *What if* &nbsp;you could integrate new devices within minutes and not weeks?

- *What if* &nbsp;your lab was truly modular, agile, and digital?

Say goodbye to unsustainable and say hello to the agile lab!
