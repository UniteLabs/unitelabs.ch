### Full Control

Go beyond data extraction with access to the full device functionality in real-time
::::

::::content{.w-1/2.px-8}
### All Access

All systems connected to the Integration Layer become a resource in a uniform API. The lab as a service!

## The agile laboratory

Every lab is different and processes change. In the end, this leaves many manual steps, incomplete data, and missed potential.

- What if adapting the tools to the new process was something you could do yourself and in minutes?

- What if you could gather instrument data, build visualisations and automate physical processes with a single source of truth?

- What if you could prototype a new automated step, tweak it, and finally scale it up into a long-running application from the same platform?

- What if you could get all your device data digitised, automated, and stored securely?

- What if your lab was truly modular, agile, and digital?

Say goodbye to unsustainable and say hello to the agile lab!

### Superpower existing apps

Tools in the lab environment suffer from incomplete data, missing device access, and overall difficult connectivity. Change that and give you lab superpowers!
